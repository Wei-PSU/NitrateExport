**Abstract**: Eutrophication has threatened water resources worldwide, yet mechanistic understanding on controls of nutrient export remains elusive. This work tests the shallow and deep hypothesis: subsurface vertical chemical contrasts regulate nitrate export patterns under different land use conditions. We synthesized data from 228 watersheds and used reactive transport modeling (500 simulations) under broad land use, climate, and geology conditions. Data synthesis indicated that human perturbation has amplified chemical contrasts in shallow water (e.g., soil water) versus deep waters (e.g., groundwater), inducing primarily flushing patterns (concentrations increase with streamflow) in agriculture lands and dilution patterns (concentrations decrease with streamflow) in urban watersheds. Results revealed a quantitative relationship between export patterns and shallow-versus-deep concentration contrasts, underscoring the often-overlooked role of nutrient distribution over depth. Results challenge the commonly held perception that legacy stores in agricultural lands induce chemostasis where concentrations vary negligibly with streamflow. They suggest that nitrate concentrations from agricultural lands will escalate during large hydrological events, which can exacerbate nutrient export problems as flooding events intensify in the future climate.

**Data source**. Nitrate data from a total of 228 sites across the contiguous United States were analyzed. This includes 147 sites from the National Water-Quality Assessment (NAWQA) project with, a national network established to monitor stream water quality since 1991. The NAWQA has daily discharge and monthly water quality data across four land use categories, i.e., agriculture, mixed, undeveloped, and urban. The NAWQA sites have median and mean drainage areas of 150 and 294 km2, respectively. The USGS Water Quality Watch (WQW) (https://waterwatch.usgs.gov/wqwatch/) has a total of 71 sites and has continuous real-time water quality data (5 minutes to hourly interval) since 2014. The WQW sites are primarily located in the Midwestern “Corn Belt” agricultural region (e.g., Iowa, Illinois, Indiana) with sizes ranging from 1 to > 29,000 km2. We also examined intensively-measured data in 6 undeveloped and 4 urban sites from research network including Critical Zone Observatories (CZOs, http://criticalzone.org/national/), Long Term Ecological Research Network (LTER, https://lternet.edu/), and Watershed Function Scientific Focus Area (SFA, https://watershed.lbl.gov/). The 6 undeveloped sites include Shale Hills watershed (CZO, Pennsylvania), East River and Coal Creek watersheds (SFA, Colorado), Sleepers River Research Watershed (Vermont), Hubbard Brook Experimental Forest W1 and W6 watershed (LTER, New Hampshire). The 4 urban sites are located within the Gwynns Fall Watershed (Baltimore Ecosystem Study LTER, Maryland), including Dead Run, Glyndon, Gwynnbrook, and Carroll Park. For USGS sites, discharge (or streamflow) and nitrate data were retrieved from the National Water Information System (https://waterdata.usgs.gov/nwis). 

**Land use classification**. The sites were classified based on the percentage of major land use according to the following criteria from USGS. Agricultural sites have > 50% agricultural land and <= 5% urban land; urban sites have > 25% urban land and <= 25% agricultural land; undeveloped sites have <= 5% urban land and <= 25% agricultural land; all other combinations of urban, agricultural, and undeveloped land percent are classified as mixed land use. Land use in the NAWQA sites were from Spahr, et al. (2010). Land use in the WQW sites was compiled from multiple sources including EPA water quality reports, USGS watershed management plan, USDA watershed assessment report, and the National Land Cover Database. Out of the 228 sites, the number of agriculture, mixed, undeveloped, and urban sites are 61, 78, 49, and 40, respectively.
